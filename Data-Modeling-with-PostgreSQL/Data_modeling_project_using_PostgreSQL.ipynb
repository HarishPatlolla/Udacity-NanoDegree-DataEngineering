    "# Project: Data Modeling with Postgres\n",
    "\n",
    "**Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "    A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their \n",
    "    new music streaming app. The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are\n",
    "    listening to. Currently, they don't have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON \n",
    "    logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.\n",
    "\n",
    "    They'd like a data engineer to create a Postgres database with tables designed to optimize queries on song play\n",
    "    analysis, and bring you on the project. Your role is to create a database schema and ETL pipeline for this analysis.\n",
    "    You'll be able to test your database and ETL pipeline by running queries given to you by the analytics team from \n",
    "    Sparkify and compare your results with their expected results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Project Description**\n",
    "      \n",
    "     In this project, you'll apply what you've learned on data modeling with Postgres and build an ETL pipeline\n",
    "     using Python. To complete the project, you will need to define fact and dimension tables for a star schema \n",
    "     for a particular analytic focus, and write an ETL pipeline that transfers data from files in two local\n",
    "     directories into these tables in Postgres using Python and SQL."
